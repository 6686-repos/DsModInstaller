# Ds Mod Installer
This is a simple mod installer/manager for discord that runs locally [my own fork](https://github.com/6686-repos/sheltupdate6686) of [sheltupdate](https://github.com/uwu/sheltupdate) \
\
To install it just download the installer from the [latest release](https://github.com/6686-repos/DsModInstaller/releases/latest) \
To use it once it's installed right click on the DsModInstaller icon in the taskbar tray and click on "configure discord"
