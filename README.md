# DS Mod Installer
a mod installer for discord, it just locally runs my own fork of [sheltupdate](https://github.com/uwu/sheltupdate) ([sheltupdate6686](https://github.com/6686-repos/sheltupdate6686)) 
to use it just [download the installer](https://github.com/6686-repos/DsModInstaller/releases/download/0.1.0/installer.bat) run it and then select the discord branch in the window that appears
